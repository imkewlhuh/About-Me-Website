      <p>
        This little boy is Mylo, the newest addition to the family.
        <br>Mylo was a stray found on the streets of Lower Manhattan only a few days ago.
        <br>He was small, scared, and sick. As we nursed him back to health, his belly grew.
        <br>He often found comfort laying on my belly. We are now belly bros.
        <br>I decided to keep him.
